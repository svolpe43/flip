## Flipper
###### A chrome workspace navigation tool.

Flipper is a easy way to store and organize a bunch of frequently used urls. It creates an easy way
to "flip" between urls very easily while letting Flipper handle finding and changing the tabs for you.

### Installation
	- Go to to the url "chrome://extensions/" or you can get to it throught the chrome settings
	- Make sure you are in developer mode but checking the box in the top right corner
	- Click load unpacked extension and choose the file that contains this code, and your done!
	- To view the console on the background process, click the "background page" link under the Flipper extension on this page

#### TODO
	- hook up hot keys, on proc alert the user of the name and path in a fading modal in bottom right corner
    - saving input to populate on the next popup open
    - show the active tab(group) and link
    - (dreaming) jira integration for automatic group creation based on current sprint
