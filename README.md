Flip is a easy way to store and organize a bunch of frequently used urls. It creates an easy way
to "flip" between urls very easily while letting Flipper handle finding and changing the tabs for you.

- To view the console on the background process, click the "background page" link under the Flipper extension on this page

#### TODO
- jira integration for automatic group creation based on current sprint, use a content script to scrape the data
